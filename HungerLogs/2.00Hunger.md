Now going to use EVP library in openssl since apparently SHA functions deprecated

Began implementing sign function in transaction class. Using the MDCTX function from EVP,
I can new up a message digest, a hash function,


BIO_new_mem_buf() creates a memory BIO; you can find this in the transaction class sign function implementation. THere's a need to have a secure memory for handling private keys, you don't want this data in a hard disk on a computer that might have unauthorized access. Advantage is reduce risk of exposure. Data in memory can be encrypted as an added layer of security; better control of access by other programs, this memory bio is also temporary storage--the space taken up in memory will be wiped at the end of the operation. 

In the transaction class, the read_bio_privateKey function is n OpenSSL for reading a private ke from a BIO, note we are passing that into the function;

the EVP_PKEY structure is a high-level abstraction used to represent cryptographic keys.

Remember we are trying to read a private key from a BIO structure

//where we have null pointers in the function arguments, see  if in the future there's room for callback functions like: password handling or custom data

So in summary: Two steps
1. We read the private key from the BIO structure; remember the BIO structure is where the private key is securely stored in memory.
2. Incorporate this private key read from BIO structure into an EVP_structure, openssl abstraction that can allow for other openssl cryptographic functions: example signing


the EVP_PKEY represents an asymmetric key


We have three functions that initiates, update, and finalizes
the signing process
in those three functions, we pass a message digest that carries the state of the hashin algorithm
