Basic C++ thing I'm picking up on. Even basic programming concepts. I'm trying to generate a keypair using OpenSSl's EVP structure. 
But I was confused by the return type being something like this EVP_PKEY* but in the function, I was declaring a variable with a pointer to the EVP structure
    EVP_PKEY *pkey is pointing the structure in memory
    but pkey itself without * (or pkey->) holds the address value of structure. 

the EVP_PKEY_RSA is a constant used to tell the function that we're using RSA algorithm

the context newing id function creates a public algorithm context that we will use to generate the keys.

1. the Add version checksum function in the wallet.cpp file, is where we 

two purposes
A. differentiate between addresses on networks. If you're on a test net vs the main network for example. That's where the Version Byte plays a role. Helps prevent transactions being made on wrong network, by allowing us to differentiate.

B. Checksum for error detection. Derived from hashed public key used to check for errors in address. When Foodcoin is being used, the checksum is calculated/recalculated and compared to what is derived from the address itself. This can prevent errors/typos and possibly prevent sending to a nonexistence/invalid address.
