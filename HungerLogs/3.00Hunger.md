Basic C++ thing I'm picking up on. Even basic programming concepts. I'm trying to generate a keypair using OpenSSl's EVP structure. 
But I was confused by the return type being something like this EVP_PKEY* but in the function, I was declaring a variable with a pointer to the EVP structure
    EVP_PKEY *pkey is pointing the structure in memory
    but pkey itself without * (or pkey->) holds the address value of structure. 

the EVP_PKEY_RSA is a constant used to tell the function that we're using RSA algorithm

the context newing id function creates a public algorithm context that we will use to generate the keys.
